# NewAlways
Chrome Extension to redirect reddit/hn pages to their 'new | newest'
equivalents.

Originally, I was going to focus my senior thesis on analyzing online voting
and reputation systems such as Reddit and HN. As part of this, I wanted to
understand people's motivation for submitting and voting on new content. With a
site as big as Reddit, why risk looking at bad content when the front page has
all of the hits anyways.

This is an example of the [Paradox
of Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting), where the cost of
voting exceeds the expected benefits.

Ultimately, my thesis changed directions, but still this extension tries to
encourage users to participate more in these communities.
